# DefaultWiki

Version: **0.5.0** - MVP

A simple flat-file, markdown-based, lightweight wiki software, meant for simple private instances.

## TODO: Build Instructions

There are a bunch of stuff that still needs to get done before I actually release a build.

## Who is this meant for?

Right now no one.

### Who is this Wiki going to be meant for?

People who just need a quick and dirty, but functional wiki software. Just to be able have documents shared between a group of trusted peers.

## Limitations

1. Requires files to in the folder that the `wiki.exe` is being run from.
2. Entirely file-based, speed is dependant on the I/O.
3. Wiki Looks okay. Could be better.
4. Markdown is limited to the Editor that I am using.
